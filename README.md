# Spost  
## A break to your scrolling dopamine  

Spost is a Firefox extension that helps you control your scrolling habits.  
Itâ€™s not just another timer app, it **detects how much time you spend on each reel** and classifies it into categories like *too fast*, *quite fast*, or *perfect* for maintaining a healthy attention span.  

If you scroll too fast in a given interval, Spost will show a popup warning you to slow down, and even add a **5-second delay** before you can continue.  
Like other productivity tools, it also includes a **session time limit**, once reached, the tab will automatically close.
