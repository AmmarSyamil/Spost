## A break to your scrolling dopamine  

Spost is a Firefox extension that helps you control your scrolling habits.  
Itâ€™s not just another timer app, it detects how much time you spend on each reel and classifies it into categories like too fast, quite fast, or perfect for maintaining a healthy attention span.
