# ![Demo image](./icons/16x16.png) Spost  
## A break to your scrolling dopamine  

Spost is a Firefox extension that helps you control your scrolling habits in **Instagram reels**.  
Itâ€™s not just another timer app, it detects how much time you spend on each reel and classifies it into categories like too fast, quite fast, or perfect for maintaining a healthy attention span.

If you scroll too fast in a given interval, Spost will show a popup warning you to slow down, and even add a 5-second delay before you can continue.  
Like other productivity tools, it also includes a session time limit, once reached, the tab will automatically close.
